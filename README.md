## Explorer Context Menu DYNAMIC CREATION through VB\! \(i\.e\., a vb menu context handler\)


</div>

### Description

This code is something that isn't often seen done in VB. Even for C, documentation is poor, examples are shoddy and unintelligible, and everything is HARD. But here it is. This is known in shell extension terms as a context menu handler. When explorer goes to create a right-click menu, it calls this dll because of entries in the registry, and the dll can add entries to the menu, and do some neat stuff, just like winzip. This is a fairly simple version of shell extensions, but by following the same principles, it can be grown upon for all the menu handlers, copy hook handlers, drag drop handlers, etc, and even into the shell namespace extensions.

Very rare, and spectacular, you want to download this code! (And vote, too!)
